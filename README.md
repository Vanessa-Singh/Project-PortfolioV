# Project-PortfolioV

 Interactive web application project with a particular focus on client-side code. It incorporate a 3rd party weather API, and it has multiple view states. The client-side framework being used is React.

# Workflow
Workflow is described in 4 categories representing each weekly task for the month of December 2019.


# 1. Research & Preproduction
	During the first week I research for possible project ideas that could work with the assigned requirements for the project. I came to find and liked that a weather app could be an excellent project to work on this month. I continued researching to what can I create for the components and the multiple states that are required as well other requirements. Once a plan has been written down on a piece of paper, I proceeded to demonstrate the proposal to the instructor.


# 2. Early Development
	In the second week I began to update the wireframe I had created in week one. I chose the colors and created a mockup of each view. I labeled the views Main, Current and Forecast. I then proceeded to start developing the project by installing React first then creating the components and lastly setting the pages, what will be the state views. 

# 3. Continued development
	At this stage I have all the components created and the initial view of the pages. I worked throughout this week giving functionalities to the components and validating that each event works how it was intended by running constant test in the app. I then proceeded to start styling the app.

# 4. Presentation
	For the last week I worked mainly on design and tweaking any bugs or error that I came across while continuously testing the app. I then realized that the best option to demonstrate the user a 404 error is by creating another state view for the error. I completed most of the design and ensure that no bug or unwanted error came up by continuously testing the app.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
