# Project-PortfolioV

# Workflow
Workflow is described in 4 categories representing each weekly task for the month of December 2019.


# 1. Research & Preproduction
	During the first week I research for possible project ideas that could work with the assigned requirements for the project. I came to find and liked that a weather app could be an excellent project to work on this month. I continued researching to what can I create for the components and the multiple states that are required as well other requirements. Once a plan has been written down on a piece of paper, I proceeded to demonstrate the proposal to the instructor.
